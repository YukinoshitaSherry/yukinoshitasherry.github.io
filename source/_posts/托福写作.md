本人整理 & b站/CC98等网络资源 & 新航道托福一对一学习资料，自用为主


## 总览

- 不需要逻辑太严密，这不是考逻辑的GRE写作
- 书面用语！写cannot/I am...不要写带'的缩略形式，注意标点符号后空一格，写数字要1,000这样三位一个逗号
- 不需要太华丽生僻的辞藻(不同于雅思)，但是还是需要记一些句式和替换词汇丰富内容
- 留出时间检查低级错误，如语法错误(三单、时态等)&拼写错误
[遣词造句与语法检查看这里](/托福写作遣词造句)


## Intergrated Writing
**3分钟读文章，3分钟听力，听力内容反驳文章内容，20分钟写作，建议150~225词，可以写350词左右。**
- 写的时候看的见阅读材料，看不见听力材料，记录听力内容



<br>

### 技巧
- 趁着前面听力阅读(指前面的答题part)转场讲话的间隙，休息+默写模板，在可以留空的地方留空，打（）或画横线，到时候直接把写作的听力阅读的笔记填进去，节约时间也确保能正确使用模板。

- 听力的总观点态度一定要**原封不动听写出来**
	- **but none holds up well under examination**
	- **not convincing**
	- it’s very easy to explain why the seemingly common-sense explanations in the reading passage **are actually wrong**.
	- Despite what the reading says, it’s perfectly possible that the white orca called Iceberg by Russian scientists is **in fact** the same individual that was spotted earlier near Alaska.
	- There are **reasons to doubt** each of the ratings claims advantages
	- Proposing that it is flawed

- 节省时间，阅读部分一句话，保总观点，适当补充原因细节。
	- 一个点一般写一句阅读材料+两句听力材料
	- 读文章的时候，记下来topic和3个evidence；听力材料就是去分条反驳这3个evidence，记下来反驳的逻辑。
	- 听听力时至少为每一个点记录下两句内容，记录这两句的**逻辑关系**
- **不需要写总结句!**
- 来不及则舍弃阅读，一定要**把听力内容保全**写下来。
- 词数至少250+，最好300+。
- 检查，没有语法错误拼写错误等。

<br>

注意：
模板要灵活运用
刚开始可以完全参考，熟悉了之后可以进行同义替换，形成自己的写作风格
【同义替换】

Second, the reading states that 阅读分论点2+细节概括 . Nevertheless, the lecture deems that 听力分论点2. He/She further explains that 听力细节1. Additionally/In contrast/Thus, 听力细节2.
Finally, the reading asserts that 阅读分论点3+细节概括 . On the other hand, the speaker maintains that 听力分论点3. He/She proves it by pointing out that 听力细节1 . In addition/Nevertheless/As a result, 听力细节2.

#### 网络资料

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">段落中间空行</mark>
- 300+词，350左右为佳
综合写作要点:
1.阅读观点+原因:观点句要改写，原因简化点，听力反对啥，你阅读证据概括啥，不要长篇大论:听力内容尽可能用原词，内容尽可能要详细【阅读原因概括原则:听力反对的内容，一定不能少，没有反对的，想加可以加】
2.听力笔记要点，每句话挑出来2-3个关键词
3.在提出观点的词汇的用法上，要多样化。
4.转折词汇的应用上，要多样
5.如果听力实在听不出来，那么可以多概括一些阅读的内容
6.字数 300-350词汇补充:
词汇补充:
观点词:Mention,refute, contend, argue point out, contradict, find out,believe, hold, disagree, consider
转折词:Conversely, on the contrary,however, nonetheless, nevertheless

#### 李文勍模板

- 10秒内确定提纲是以下两种的哪一种

##### 直接型
学术写作--题目思路+框架(直给型，直接认可以一位同学的观点)
1.表达自己支持哪一位同学的观点:From my point of view, l tend to support WHO's opinion that...
2.提出自己补充的观点:Apart from+该同学的理由, another reasonlwant toadd is that+提出自己的新理由In addition,in my view
3.解释论证自己的观点:In other words,…/Especcially these days
4.举例论证支持自己的观点:For instance/take somebody as an examplefor example
5.总结:All in all/Therefore/in conclusion
范文:
From my perspective, I tend to support Penny's opinion children should not be allowed to watch a lot of videos online.
Apart from her reasons. another reason I want to add is that children are usually under 12 years old and at this stage, they usually cannot tell right from wrong. In this case, giving children the permit to watch videos online for entertainment may expose them to something that may impact their lives negatively as in the information era, everyone can be the author of online materials. For instance,somebody may post a video of violence, like beating people or violent games, to be eye-catching. Children who watch that video may feel excited by that video and may even want to imitate the behaviors in the video instead of turning it off in disgust.
To sum up, watching videos is not a good way to entertain for children.
<br>

##### 让步型
学术写作--题目思路+框架(让步型，先同意他说说法是有道理的，然后指出他考虑得不足的地方)
1.让步认可一位同学的观点:WHO present a compelling argument that
2.让步认可的理由:Admittedly,WHO is right when
3.转折提出自己的观点:Nevertheless,considering(这位同学没有考虑到的点),
am inclined to....
4.给予新的支持理由:In my view,…
5.解释陈述:In other words,….
6.例证细节:For example,….
7.总结观点:Therefore.
Andrew presents a compelling/convincing/persuasiove argument in favor of endorsing student sports activities. Admittedly,sports participation is a superb means to promote students' physical health. Nevertheless, considering the university's responsibilities in fostering academic preeminence, I am inclined toprioritize the construction of a new library. 
In my view, a new library can enhance teaching and scholarly communication. A well-equipped library, serving as a platform for academic exchange and cooperation, not only provides access to print books but also offers high-speed Internet connectivity and databases for interdisciplinary collaborations. For example,as collaborative programs across disciplines continue to increase, both faculty and students in our Architecture Department require establishing a new library that enhances networks across departments, which will profoundly enrich the interdisciplinary collaboration database.
Therefore, I firmly believe that giving priority to constructing a new library through integrating multidisciplinary materials will substantially improve scholarly communication and strengthen our research capabilities.

##### educate or research
I am of the opinion that professors should focus on research. From the perspective of society at large, professors’ commitment to scholarship is crucial to progress in science and technology. Research, after all, is meant to probe into the unknown and unravel mysteries. Such exploration requires a high standard of professional knowledge as well as creativity on the part of researchers. Only with such skills can science break new ground. Accordingly, there is no doubt that it is the intellectual elite, rather than ordinary people, that are the **driving force** of technological advances. If professors were forced to give up their projects, there would be no one with the required ability to carry out scientific inquiry. The result would be **a dearth of** groundbreaking discoveries and inventions with the potential to reshape our lives. Compared with scientific exploration, educating students is less demanding in the sense that a teacher needs only to impart established knowledge found in textbooks through the vehicle of lectures. That is why, in order to promote the continued development of science and technology, it is more appropriate for professors to concentrate their efforts on research, and not to lecture. (194 words)

##### 跟团vs自由行
I would not choose to join a group when planning a trip, as visitors will face the possibility of making unwanted purchases during the trip. More specifically, it is one of the underlying rules of the tourism industry that guides **receive commission**收取回扣 from certain tourist sites, restaurants and shops. Thus, **driven by personal profit**, some tour guides may lead the group to these places and try their best to encourage spending. Souvenirs are always more expensive and meals are overpriced. Consequently, travelers often **suffer additional financial losses**. A real-life experience that provides a vivid example is this: I once joined a guided tour to Hainan, a popular scenic spot that boasts attractive seashores and delicious seafood. During the tour, our guide took us to a shop selling marine products and succeeded in persuading several tourists to buy goods there. I later found out that similar items were much cheaper at other stores. Similar examples abound in our daily lives, suggesting that it may not be a good idea to participate in a **staged**有组织的 tour.
