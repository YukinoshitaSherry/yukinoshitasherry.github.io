以下为 **微信小程序-考拉托福** 的口语练习TPO1~54为主。
考拉判分均为27+

## 个人经历

>【TPO54】Some people say that childhood is the best time in a person's life. Other people disagree.

Agree.
It is the only time that a person can enjoy unconditional love and support from their parents.
eg when I was young I always mess up while doing housework, hardly can I even hold the broom well. It is my parents who taught me how to use the broom correctly, and encouraged me with great patience. In contrast, now I grow up and live far away from them, Overcoming all the obstacles on my own is the norm, which means great pressure.

有时间第二点 also freedom with no worries 
play soccer with friends->just running and lauging，cheer for every goals
now-> anxiety with work ,less free time

## 生活方式

>【TPO53】Extra money:spend right away or save

Prefer spend right away.
Although it is important to save for the rainy days,the basic aim of earning money is to live a better live.
eg last week I spent my part-time job salary on a trip to West Lake
view beautiful scenery which looks like delicate oil painting
go boating -> when paddling and feeling the gentle breeze->all worries and stress faded away
after the trip ->refreshed->devote to work -> finish job more effective

<br>

>【TPO52】Enjoy themselves at concerts or films or go with friends

Prefer with friends
go with friends can not only add to the excitement, but also enhance uor friendship
eg last week I go to cinema with my friends
discuss the plot and character, when it comes to scary part -> held each other's hand & scream together
after-> go for a dinner together ->exchange ideas about favortie part, sharing feelings from different aspects.->know each other better.

<br>

>【TPO50】have a wide variety of friends and acquaintances they can spend time with or spend most of their free time with the same samll group of close friends.

【复用TPO52】
Well, I prefer spend most of my free time with the small group of friends who is very close to me. The reason is that the quality of the friends should always override the quantity of the friends. It's much easier for us to maintain our friendship with a group of close friends who share the same interest with us, rather than get in touch with a variety of friends who seem verydifferent from us.
For example, both me and my small group enjoy movies, so we can talk about our favorite films, discuss character and plot,share our ideas from different aspects, which make us know each other more and definitely enhance our friendship.
In addition, a friend in needis a friend indeed, Only closer friends can help us when we in need, so I prefer close friends.

<br>


>【TPO48】 shop in large grocery stores and department stores or shop in small specialty stores

Prefer large grocery stores and department stores.
only in thses large shops canwe have a variety products to choose. 
eg last week I shopped in the big grocery store Walmart.->
only in that one trip I bought evreything I need,from daily food like cheese to electronic products like earphones.
->convenient and efficient->save my time and  transportation fee.
In addition->offer membership discounts
eg in the shopping trip I mentioned above, my membership card save me 20 dollars,which was really a good deal.
`
<br>

>【TPO42】some people prefer live in big city, other living in countryside, away from urban areas.which do you think is better?

country side.
Living in the countryside has numerous advantages that contribute to a better quality of life. 
Firstly, the fresh air and natural surroundings promote physical health. For instance, I often go hiking in the mountains, which not only strengthens my body but also allows me to enjoy the beauty of nature. In contrast, in urban areas, it's common to see air pollusion, which make me cough a lot.
Additionally, the slower pace of life in the countryside reduces stress levels. I can spend my weekends gardening or walking by the river, which makes me refreshed and helps me recharge. 


## 教育学习

>Teachers should encourage students to have class discussion.

 Well,I support teachers regularly requiring students to participate in classroom discussions. First of all, classroom discussion can help students acquire knowledge faster. When students organize language and make speeches, they can pay more attention to whether their logic is rigorous and whether they have fully understood the knowledge, so as to carry out supplementary learning. Second, in the process of discussion, different viewpoints often emerge. Students may learn to listen to others, express themselves, and embrace new perspectives during debate. With the active guidance of teachers, students also
 have the opportunity to learn extracurricular knowledge. Therefore, I support this
 statement.

<br>

>【TPO49】Some teachers think that it is important for studentsto sit in assigned seats, that is, to sit in the same place every day in class. Other teachers think that students should be allowed to choose where they wil sit. andthey allow them to sit in different seats on different days.

Prefer choose
not only improve academic performance but also foster a sense of community in the class
one day sit nearby a student good at math->solve complex problems
another day sit nerby a studnet have a good command of history->analyze reading material, excahnge ideas from different aspects on history event
have a deeper understanding of the subject meanwhile enhance their firendship.

<br>   

>【TPO44】 primary schools should noonger teach children how to write by hand, and instead should spend time teaching them how to typeon a computer or it is still important for schools to teach children to have good hand writing. 

focus on teaching student how to type rather than how to write by hand.
The reason is that the typing skills cannot only improve the students' academic performance but also equip them with essential skills they need for their future job.
For example, a student who have learned how to type can search the information he wants on the internet, where there are a vast number of materials he can get access to.-> get better scores in essential tests.
In addition, nowadays great companies such as amazon and meta wanted great candidates who have skilled digital problems solving abilities, which means if they learn how to type quickly when they're young, they will  gain more job opportunities in thefuture.

<br>

>【TPO43】Some students attend colege full-time, while othersattend college part-time. 
Well, I prefer to attend college part time. 
The reason is that only then can we acquire not only the theoretical knowledge from the university classes, but also the practical skills we need for our future job.
nowadays,the competition in the job market have become increasingly fierce, only with the internship experience can we get our dream job's offer.
eg,one of my friends learned how to manage the budget and arrange meeting when she doing her internship at a big company and attend college part-time the sametime. At last she managed to get her dream job via this precious experience. 
In addition, The college tuition fee can be a great burden for students,If you attend an internship part-time. you can earn money and release your monentary pressure.

<br>

>【TPO41】Some people believe it is important for universities to provide funding for student entertainment, such as movies or concerts on campus. Others believe thatuniversity money should only be used for academic purposes.

Well, I believe it is essential for university to provide funding for students' entertainment. 
The reason is that it not only benefit their physical helth, but their mental health as well. As we all know, nowadays, students burden quite a lot stress finishing their heavy load of assignments. They may staring at the screen, cramming for exam in the library all day, which will cause them to be near-sighted and obeses.
Entertainment such as sports can help them to keepfit,which is really good to their physical health.
In addition, many students may feel frustrated by the stress, Entertainment such as watching a movie can serve as an escape from daily pressure, wihch can boost their confidence and alleviate their worries, help them to be refreshed and devote to their academic work later.



## 社会话题

>【TPO51】18 year old are not mature enough to vote

Disagree.
They have already finish high school courses like politics and economics->equipped them with enough knowledge to vote.
in this era of technology, it is the younger generation who have more opportunity and willingness to explore the political news on the internet. apart from that they can follow their favorite candidates on twitter ou insgram->comment about events,interact with each other
Thus, I firmly believe that 18 year old can bring new power to our democratic politic system and they should be engaged in voting.

<br>

>【TPO47】agree or disagree  in the future people will read fewer books than today

Disagree.
One reason is the enduring appeal of physical books; many readers cherish the tactile experience of turningpages.
Additionally, in this fast-pased world, reading **serves as a wonderful escape from daily stress**. For instance, **after a long day at work, I often find solace in novels like "Harry Potter"** ,which transport me to mgaical worlds and let me forget all the worries.->refreshed devote to work next day
Furthermore,the rise of e-books allows for more accessibility,encouraging diverse reading habits. Many people are also joining bookclubs, fostering a community around reading. ->share ideas about plot and characters from different aspect（复用和朋友看电影的语料）->enhance friendship add to the entertainment
Thus **I believe that the love for reading wil continue to thrive,adapting to new formats while maintaining its essential joy.**
选两点展开 我倾向于 1.压力 2.社交

<br>

>【TPO46】 people today have healthier lifestyle than 100 years ago

Disagree.
physically:
nowadays live a sidentary life -> sit in front of desk and staring at te screen
eat fast food -> rich in oil and fat->become obese
vs: 100 yrs ago tend to eat organic food and exercise more 
mentally:
now heavy work load -> stressed out
vs 100 yrs ago that's not that much to worry about


<br>

>【TPO45】 artists and musicians are important to a society

【注意对象，society,不是个人】
Agree.
they can foster a sense of community with love and hope.
eg in pandedemic time->art works and music pieces that encouraged us to go through the hard time of lock down and recovered to live a better life in the future
community events like local concerts and art fairs bring people together,->folk artwork ->proud of our own culture ->create a sense of belonging.


inspire change and raise awareness about social issues.
eg some street artists （Banksy）'s work often comments on political injustices, calling for refection, which contributes to social progress.

>【TPO40】Some people think that materials printed on paper such as books and newspapers. will one day be replaced by electronic versions of those materials Others believe that printed materials wil always be popular.

I agree with the point that the electronic versions of materials will prevail.
The reason is that it is not only convenient but also environmental friendly. With the rapid growth of technology, nowadays, we have a lot of devices such as kindle, tablet which can store a large volume of books in such a tiny place. If I want to go on a journey with a book of one thousand page, hardly can I carry a paper version. 
However,the ebook version is really convenient,I can read the book whenever I wantand, and make notes immediately.
In addition. The ebooks are environmental friendly, for we need to use less paper, which means we can cut down less trees. This will definitely benefit our ecosystems.
